## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart") # load in instacart dataset
```

The Instacart dataset is 1384617 x 15. The variable names are order\_id,
product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id, eval\_set,
order\_number, order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day,
days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id,
aisle, department.

The data consists of individual order information, including the order
number, the product being ordered (a numeric ID and string name), the
order an item was added to the cart, the user who ordered, the time the
order was placed (day of the week as an ordinal number and hour of the
day), whether the item had been reordered (binary), and the location of
the item (department and aisle as numeric ID and string). There is also
a variable that defines whether the observation is in the train or test
set for model validation.

Example product names: Bulgarian Yogurt, Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole Milk
Cottage Cheese, Organic Celery Hearts, Cucumber Kirby, Lightly Smoked
Sardines in Olive Oil, Bag of Organic Bananas.

Example department names: dairy eggs, produce, canned goods.

# Problem 1 Questions

-   **How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?**

``` r
top_aisles = instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>%  # group by aisle
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% # sort the table by descending number of orders
  head(5)  # show top 5
```

There are 134 aisles. The top 5 most-ordered-from aisles in descending
order are: fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits,
yogurt, packaged cheese

-   **Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, desc(n))) %>% # descending sort
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    title = "Number Items Ordered per Aisle", subtitle = "For aisles with >10,000 orders",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Items Ordered (n)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

-   **Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.**

``` r
baking_ings = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients") %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

knitr::kable(head(baking_ings,3), caption = "Top 3 Products from the Baking Ingredients Aisle")

-   **Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).**

Mean Hour of the Day (24h) when Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream
Are Ordered by Day of the Week

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010") # load in dataset
```

First, do some data cleaning:

-   format the data to use appropriate variable names;
-   focus on the “Overall Health” topic
-   include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
-   organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
    “Excellent”

``` r
brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response == c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")) %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels =c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"),
                           ordered = TRUE)) %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = factor("locationdesc"))
```

\#Problem 2 Questions

-   **In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
    about in 2010?**

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  filter(n >= 7) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "States with 7 or more locations in 2002")

-   **Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
    contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
    across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
    average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing
    a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and
    group aesthetic will help).**

``` r
brfss_excellent = brfss %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  # filter(is.na(data_value) == FALSE) %>% # if you want to remove NJ since it is NA
  group_by(year,state) %>%

Average Values of States Reporting “Excellent” Overall Health

**Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state
(that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the
geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).**

  group_by(year,state) %>%
  summarize(avg_data_value = mean(data_value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = state, color = state)) +
  geom_point(data = brfss_excellent, aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, group = state, color = state)) + geom_line(data = brfss_excellent, linetype= "dashed", aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, group = state, color = state)) +
  labs(
    title = "Change in Data Values by Year ", 
    subtitle = "States with >= 1 Site with Reported \"Excellent\" Overall Health",

    x = "Year",
    caption = "Points indicate the average value for \"Excellent\" sites only"
